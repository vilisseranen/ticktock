/* Because file descriptors can be reused, problems could arise when
 * one type of file descriptors are then being used as a different type.
 * This is because there could be a task sitting in a queue waiting for
 * CPU to process the file descriptor of previous type; when the task is
 * finally being processed, it will cause an error because the file
 * descriptor is now representing something of different type.
 *
 * To prevent this kind of problem, we will always 'assign' the same type
 * of resources to the same range of file descriptors. For example, HTTP
 * connections will always be assigned file descriptors from the last
 * section of all usable file descriptors; TCP connections, and files
 * will all have their own range of file descriptors.
